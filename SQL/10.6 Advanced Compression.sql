--Advanced row compression
/*
Rows inserted with or without using direct-path insert and updated rows 
are compressed using advanced row compression.

Is enabled with CREATE TABLE … ROW STORE COMPRESS ADVANCED
Is recommended for active OLTP environments

With advanced row compression, duplicate values in the rows and columns in a data block are stored once 
at the beginning of the block

note 1:
ROW STORE COMPRESS ADVANCED and COMPRESS BASIC are not supported for tables with more than 255
note 2: You cannot drop a column from a table that is compressed for direct-load operations, 
although you can set such a column as unused.
