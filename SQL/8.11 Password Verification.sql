/*
go to vm

try to do this
alter user test100 identified by welcome678#
Cause : ORA-28221 error occurs when an user tries to reset his own password 
without specifying the REPLACE keyword, provided the user does not have ALTER USER privilege 
and the user is having a profile with password verify function.
so
it should be
alter user test100 identified by welcome678# replace welcome1234#
