/*
A tempfile is a file that is part of an Oracle database. 
Tempfiles are used with TEMPORARY TABLESPACES

Temporary tablespaces are used for special operations, particularly for sorting data results on disk and for 
hash joins in SQL. For SQL with millions of rows returned, the sort operation is too large for the RAM 
area and must occur on disk.  
The temporary tablespace is where this takes place
