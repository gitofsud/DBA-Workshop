/*
Managing Resumable Space Allocation
A resumable statement:
1- Enables you to suspend large operations instead of receiving an error
2- Gives you a chance to fix the problem while the operation is suspended, rather
than starting over
3-Is suspended for the following conditions:
>>Out of space
>>Maximum extents reached
>>Space quota exceeded
4-Can be suspended and resumed multiple times
